Subject: Request for help in reaching out to the students in the CS 375 class


Our group at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (www.tacc.utexas.edu<http:=
//www.tacc.utexas.edu>) is working on an "Interactive Parallelization Tool"=
, and we are looking to hire undergraduate/graduate students. I feel that t=
he students in your CS 375 class would be equipped with some of the skills =
that we need for this project.

Pasted below is the description of the currently open student-positions, an=
d a short overview of the project. Would it be possible to share it with th=
e students in your CS 375 course?

Thanks & Regards,
Ritu

Job Title: URA, GRA
Hours per week: 20 hrs
Employment Start Date: January 1, 2017
Employment End Date: September 30, 2018

We are looking to hire one URA and one GRA for an NSF funded project that s=
tarted on November 1, 2016. Preference will be given to students who can co=
mmit to 20 hours per week of work during regular semesters, and 40 hours pe=
r week of work during summers. Interested students should email their resum=
e to "rauta@tacc.utexas.edu" with the following subject line: "URA/GRA posi=
tion - IPT project". Students wishing to start earlier than January 1, 2017=
 are encouraged to apply (by submitting their resume).

Required Qualifications and Skills:

  *   Currently enrolled undergraduate or graduate student at The Universit=
y of Texas at Austin
  *   Minimum of a 3.0 GPA
  *   Majoring in Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, or a related =
area
  *   Proficient in C/C++ and/or Fortran, working knowledge of Java, enthus=
iasm to learn and use a source-to-source compiler (ROSE compiler), familiar=
ity with the Linux Operating System
  *   High degree of personal responsibility
  *   Good communication and presentation skill
  *   Ability to work independently under established deadlines and as part=
 of a team

Preferred skills for the project:
Knowledge of compiler design, design patterns, and parallel programming (MP=
I/OpenMP/CUDA)

Description of the project:
An Interactive Parallelization Tool (IPT) is being developed in this resear=
ch project. The tool is designed to support the parallelization of serial a=
pplications written in C/C++ and Fortran. The parallel programming paradigm=
s that will be supported by the tool are MPI, OpenMP, CUDA, and MPI+X.

Description of the duties:

The URA/GRA will assist in the following activities related to the aforemen=
tioned project:

  *   Analyzing serial and parallel implementations of the selected test-ca=
ses to develop high-level abstractions
  *   Implementing code templates in C/C++/Fortran as needed in the project
  *   Developing code transformation rules using the ROSE source-to-source =
compiler
  *   Writing bash scripts for automating the workflow in the tool
  *   Refactoring and enhancing the existing code base
  *   Testing the tool
  *   Developing the command-line and graphical user interfaces of the tool

Through this project, the URA/GRA will gain valuable skills in developing a=
bstractions and hence high-level tools that can be of immense help to domai=
n-experts. Students will learn about high performance computing and will ge=
t to work on one of the top supercomputers in the world.

If you have any questions, please feel free to write to Ritu Arora at rauta=
